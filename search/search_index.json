What is Binokula? Binokula is a report sharing website which provides an organization with the power to securely share reports with their business affiliates. Affiliates could be customers, suppliers, subsidiaries, dealers, franchisees, brokers, agents, frontline workers, business associates or partners. Binokula attempts to address most of the common problems associated with secure report sharing. With Binokula you will be able to: Easily expose secure, interactive reports created with Microsoft Power BI. Seamlessly integrate Binokula with your existing portal. Restrict users' access to only their reports and data. Scale up to thousands of users, if required. Track when users access their reports. Quickly publish new reports or change existing reports, all without needing a software developer. Automate the entire process, while knowing that Binokula constantly monitors the platform for you. What does Binokula look like? See for yourself by selecting one of the demo users on the Binokula demo site Reports can also be configured for mobile viewing. How does Binokula work? Binokula provides a set of services based around Microsoft Power BI. It allows you to publish and share reports built in Power BI through a centralized website. Each user will manage their own login on Binokula or you give them access through the Single-Sign-On API. Binokula ensures users can only see reports assigned to them and automatically enforces row-level security (RLS) to each report. Binokula licensing is by active users instead of named. Users don't need to be integrated with Azure Active Directory, don't require a Microsoft Account and don't need a Power BI Pro license. Step 1: Use Power BI to: Connect, prepare, model and schedule data loads Apply row-level data security Build reports and mobile views you wish to share Step 2: You use Binokula to Provide a portal for users to access their reports Provide mobile views of reports Secure access to specific reports Provide single-sign-on for users from your existing website to their reports Know that Power BI row-level security is enforced Add, delete or disable users View real-time and historical report usage Most of Binokula's existing customers use Power BI for their internal business analytics but came to Binokula to for external report sharing. A pure Power BI report sharing option would have placed unwanted constraints on users like having named Power BI Pro Licenses or Azure Active Directory accounts or having a Microsoft account. Binokula simplifies the report sharing landscape while leveraging the report delivery capabilities of Power BI. How is Binokula different to other report sharing tools? Binokula has been created specifically with secure report sharing in mind. The aim is to make it as simple and easy as possible for report builders, administrators and end users. Easy for Report Builders - Microsoft Power BI has become one of the dominant players in the self-service data preparation and visualization market. Instead of creating our own bespoke visualization framework, we want to enable anybody who is familiar with Power BI to hosts reports on the Binokula platform. Power BI also takes care of data-preparation, scheduling, storage and presentation - which means you don't have to add additional tools or infrastructure to your environment. You don't have to worry about mixing Binokula content with any existing Power BI content you might have - we create a separate Power BI tenant for you that is dedicated only to Binokula. This also ensures nobody else can access your data. Any change on a Power BI report is immediately reflected when users access the report in Binokula. Binokula even integrates with the mobile layout configuration of Power BI, which means you can create mobile views of your reports without much effort at all. Easy for Administrators - After publishing a Power BI Report, you would want your users to access their reports. This is easily managed within the Binokula application and is as simple as: Creating a report group Assigning the report to the report group Assigning users to the report groups Sending an invitation to users This process makes it easy to provide access to only the reports that you wish users to see, allowing you to create different views for different audiences. As an administrator, you will also have real-time access to the report usage metrics on Binokula. Users can also be auto-disabled if they haven't logged in after a certain number of days. You can even direct a user back to your own website if they log out of Binokula. Easy for End Users - As an end user you will be able to access Binokula with your email and password OR have single-sign-on experience from an existing portal. You also don't need to associate your email with any other authentication service. graph TB A0[User opens browser] A0-->A1[User logs on to Binokula] A0-->A2[User logs on to your website] A2-->|Your website uses Binokula SSO|A1 end Once you access Binokula you will either be: Taken directly to your report (if you have only one report assigned) OR Taken to your default report (if you saved a default report) OR Taken to the list of reports you can have access to. Reports are read-only but fully interactive and you will only see the data you are meant to. There are no additional buttons, menus or confusing user interfaces. Who uses Binokula? Binokula is used by organizations that: Need to securely share reports with users who are affiliated with their organization. Need to provide an interactive experience for users instead of emailing static PDF documents. Need to empower business users to control report sharing. Need to avoid a large and complex IT projects. Need to avoid licensing per named user. Need to be up and running as soon as possible.

This includes: Getting access to a Binokula Tenant Building and publishing a report in Power BI Desktop Providing access to reports in Binokula Automating data refreshes Getting a Binokula Tenant A Binokula Tenant is your dedicated area for publishing, hosting and managing access to your report content. Only organizations that wish to share and control access to reports need a Tenant. If you are expecting to just access reports in Binokula, you will need to be added as a User on a Tenant. If your organization wishes to get a trial Tenant, please contact sales@binokula.com . If you are expecting to already have access to reports in Binokula, you can enter your email address at https://binokula.app or contact the organization whose report content you wish to access. Building and Publishing Reports Building a Report without RLS Binokula uses Microsoft Power BI as its report building tool. It is possible for a report to be published to Binokula without any RLS. For a report to be correctly published in Binokula without RLS, the report has to adhere to the following: The User Security configuration must be set to ignored. This can be done through Report Management under Binokula Admin page. Building a Report with RLS RLS - Row-Level Security ensures that users see only the data they are authorized to see. Building a report with RLS requires that the report adhere to the following: Must have a security role called \"User_Security\" in the Power BI Model. Show \"User_Security\" example Must have a DAX filter on the Entity to User Mapping List which uses the USERNAME() function. Show USERNAME() example Cross filter direction should be set to Both for the relationship with Entity to User Mapping List Apply security filter in both directions should be ticked for the relationship with Entity to User Mapping List Show Cross Filter and Apply Security Fiter Both example Testing Power BI RLS Once you have configured the RLS as shown above, you can test the security by impersonating a user. To do this: Click \"View as Roles\" in Power BI Desktop; Tick \"Other User\" and enter the test user's email address; and Tick \"User_Security\" and click OK. Show \"View as Roles\" screen You should now only see data that the test user should see. Publishing Power BI Reports Once you have built and tested your Power BI report, the next step is to publish the report to your dedicated Tenant. This is done with the unique publisher account, details you would have received as part of requesting your Binokula Tenant. You can sign-in with the publisher account by clicking on \"Sign in\" in Power BI Desktop. If you are already signed in with a different account, click on the account name and select \"Switch account\". Once you are signed in, you can publish the report by: Saving any changes; Clicking on the \"Publish\" button on the Home menu; and Choosing \"Binokula\" as the destination before clicking \"Select\" Note: Save the report with a friendly name that you would want your users to see. Try to avoid names with abbreviations and version numbers like \"test_fin_HL_V0.13\". Editing an existing report can be done by re-publishing the same report from Power BI Desktop. Select Yes when prompted to overwrite the dataset. Another way to edit an existing report is by making changes on powerbi.com with your publisher account. Re-publishing from Power BI Desktop will override these changes. Reseting your Publisher Account Password To reset your tenants Publisher Account password: Navigate to the Administrator page Go to Portal settings Click the \"Reset Publisher Account Password\" link and confirm Copy and use the strong temporary password provided to sign into your tenants Publisher Account via Power BI Note: You will be prompt to change your password upon your initial sign in using the provided temporary password. Report for Mobile Viewing Power BI Mobile is supported by Binokula. All you need to do is create the mobile view of a report in the Power BI Desktop file and publish it to your Tenant. Please see Microsoft's Power BI Phone Report documentation for more information on configuring phone layout on Power BI Desktop. Show Phone Layout option in Power BI Desktop Managing Tenant details Assigning your organization name to your tenant Your organization name will be used in automated emails sent out to users and other front facing features that labels your tenant. Navigate to the Admin Page and click \"Portal Settings\" Under the field \"Organization Name\" enter the name of your organization. Click save. Managing access to reports in Binokula Any new reports published are by default not accessible to any users. Access to reports is controlled through Report Groups. To give yourself access to view a report, you will need to be an administrator and complete the following in Binokula: Import the report definition into Binokula by clicking on the Refresh button in the reports administration page; Create a new Report Group in the report group administration page; Add the new report to the Report Group; Add yourself as a user in the report group; and Select the report in the Reports user page. Assigning more users and reports The process is exactly the same as the previous steps, all you have to do is add more users. If it will be too time-consuming to add users by one-by-one, you can create a script to call the Binokula REST API to add users in bulk. Please see the Developer Guide for details on the REST API. If you need to expose more than one report to a specific audience, multiple reports can also be added to a Report Group through the Report Group administration page. Note: Currently communications to end users are managed by Tenant administrators. However, you can send a Forgot Password link to users directly in the User Management administration page. Typical onboarding communication contains a link to the Binokula.app page with instructions to enter their email address and then click the Reset password link. Automating and scheduling the refresh of report data Refreshing data for Binokula reports is the same as in any other Power BI report*. Any on-premise data used in the report needs to be supported by the Power BI On-Premise Data Gateway. The on-premise data gateway needs to be installed and configured with the credentials of your unique publisher account. Cloud data sources also need to be supported by the Power BI service. Additional information on Power BI's data refresh capabilities can be found here: Data refresh in Power BI Refresh Data Sources from Power BI Desktop *The Power BI Data Model still needs to have the \"User_Security\" role created in Power BI Desktop. Once you have an on-premise data gateway configured, you can access powerbi.com with your assigned publisher account and configure the schedule refresh as per the Power BI Documentation . Managing Users User Management is done through the user management link in the admin portal. This interface will allow you to: Add new users Delete users Enable/disable users Enable/disable admins Reset passwords User management functions Note: Users are automatically added when programmatically signed in with the single-sign-on API . Bulk adding, deleting, enabling or disabling more than one user at a time can be achieved programmatically by calling the User Management API . Managing Reports Report Management is done through the report management link in the admin portal. This interface will allow you to: Delete a Report. Note: If the report still exists within the Power BI Workspace the report will reappear within the next refresh. Enforce/Ignore User Security Roles on the selected report User Groups User Group Management is done through the user group link in the admin portal. The User Group management page allows admins to: Create a new User Group Delete a new User Group Edit User Group Details Assign existing users to the group Assign the User Group to one or multiple report groups User group functions User Group Structure Users within a User Group can be assigned to a Report Group. This function allows easier assignment and reassignment of multiple users to reports. RLS Aliasing Admins have the option of enabling username aliasing to their users. Users can share the same alias. By enabling RLS Aliasing the RLS then uses the users alias as the filter on the report. Your Reports filtering must be mapped to the aliasing of your choice. The RLS Aliasing and enablement can be found on the User Management page. Editing users RLS Alias Navigate to the Admin page then select \"User Management\" Find the user you want to edit their alias for Click \"Edit RLS Alias\" on the users row. This will take you to the Edit Page. Fill in your desired alias into the form Click the \"Save\" button to save your changes Enabling/Disabling one users RLS Alias Navigate to the Admin page then select \"User Management\" Find the user you want to enable/disable their alias for Click \"Edit RLS Alias\" on the users row.

Current end-points focus on user management and access to reports. All API calls are secured with SSL, tenant names and API Keys (client_secret). If you need access to your client_secret, please contact support@binokula.app . Client Secret Your Client is used to access Binokula's API endpoints. Your tenants Client Secret can be accessed by an Admin account. To find your tenants Client Secret: Sign into Binokula with an Admin account Navigate to the Administrator page Go to Portal settings Find the label Client Secret and click \"Show Client Secret\" From there you can copy the Client Secret and start using Binokula APIs! Single-Sign On Overview Single-Sign On (SSO) enables external applications to give users access to Binokula without the need for them to enter their Binokula password. Access to Binokula is gained with the combination of a user's email address and a securely generated access token. The access token is valid for one hour and can be refreshed using the API. Binokula will check if the users email is registered as a system user and if the access token is valid before granting access to the application. If authentication fails, a redirect to the Binokula login page will be executed. Only one user token can be active at any given time. sequenceDiagram User->>Organization App: User Requests access to Binokula Organization App->>Binokula API: App requests access_token from API Binokula API->>Organization App: App constructs SSO URL with token Organization App->>Binokula App: App opens Binokula App URL Binokula App->>Binokula App: If valid, Binokula reports are shown Binokula App->>Binokula App: If not valid, Binokula Login page is shown Endpoints Issue/Renew User Access Token URL: https://api.binokula.app/api/Token HTTP Verb: GET Headers: client_secret Parameters: email tenant code This is a function key provided to the customer to access this endpoint existingusersonly (optional) Boolean Default set to \"false\".

Securely providing access to interactive reports to people outside your organization is a surprisingly difficult problem to solve. You can either try to develop your own reporting portal and worry about how long it will take to develop and how much it will cost. Or you can purchase a solution and encounter some of the following issues: User licenses need to be paid, even if they don't access the reports. It is not possible to implement the solution without turning it into a large IT project. It is not possible to stop users from \"finding\" each other within the application. Software developers are required every time you need any changes to reports or add new reports. It is not possible to secure access to reports or data within reports. It is not possible provide interactive reporting. Binokula sets out to address these issues head on by wrapping an easy-to-use service around Microsoft's Power BI. We try to make secure report sharing as easy as possible. What is a Binokula provider? A Binokula provider is an organization which uses the platform to host reports for users. Can't I just use Power BI to share reports? It depends, Power BI is a terrific product but may not be an ideal fit if you want to share reports externally. Most of our customers already used Power BI for their internal business analytics. They typically encountered the following issues when they considered Power BI for external report sharing : Licensing - If you decide to share reports from powerbi.com, each external user must be licensed with a Power BI Pro license and their account needs to be either an Azure Active Directory (AD) account or a Microsoft Account. Power BI Premium avoids the need to purchase Pro licenses, but users are still required to have an Azure Active Directory account or Microsoft account. Portal Integration - If you already provide a portal for your users and you wish to integrate powerbi.com reports, you are left with 2 choices: Provide a link to a report URL and expect users to authenticate with their Azure AD or Microsoft account. Commission your portal developers to use Power BI embedded and present reports from your portal. Risk - If you are getting multiple external users onto powerbi.com, you have to manage access to reports, workspaces, apps and tenant settings to ensure users can't accidentally break something, can't see each other's email address or can't access data accidentally see data they should not be able to. How does Binokula make Power BI Report Sharing better? Binokula focuses on the common issues people encounter with Power BI report sharing while still retaining all the goodness that made them choose Power BI in the first place. Binokula will likely be a good fit for you if: you don't want : your users to have an Azure Active Directory or Microsoft account to purchase Power BI Pro licenses or Power BI Premium to start a software development project to integrate Power BI into your existing portal OR you do want: to leverage existing Power BI skills within your organization to simplify portal integration to a single API call to minimize the risk of users seeing each other's email address or access data they couldn't How do I get my reports into Binokula? Binokula reports are built in Microsoft Power BI Desktop and published to a dedicated tenant for your organization. Publishing is explained in Building and Publishing Reports section in the Admin Guide. How do I login to Binokula? Your Binokula account is managed by your Binokula provider and you should have received an email from them about accessing your reports. If you know you should already be able to view reports in Binokula, then see the Getting Started section in the User Guide. What happens if I don't know how to use Power BI? Report Viewers - Report viewers in Binokula don't need to know Power BI at all. All you need to do is login to your account and view the reports assigned to you. Report Builders - If you are a Binokula provider then you will need to learn the basics of Power BI. There are numerous free resources on the internet to get started. Binokula requires Power BI reports to be built in a specific manner. This is explained in Building and Publishing Reports section in the Admin Guide.","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"faq/#faq","text":"","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"faq/#why-should-i-use-binokula-for-report-sharing","text":"Securely providing access to interactive reports to people outside your organization is a surprisingly difficult problem to solve.

Most of our customers already used Power BI for their internal business analytics. They typically encountered the following issues when they considered Power BI for external report sharing : Licensing - If you decide to share reports from powerbi.com, each external user must be licensed with a Power BI Pro license and their account needs to be either an Azure Active Directory (AD) account or a Microsoft Account. Power BI Premium avoids the need to purchase Pro licenses, but users are still required to have an Azure Active Directory account or Microsoft account. Portal Integration - If you already provide a portal for your users and you wish to integrate powerbi.com reports, you are left with 2 choices: Provide a link to a report URL and expect users to authenticate with their Azure AD or Microsoft account. Commission your portal developers to use Power BI embedded and present reports from your portal. Risk - If you are getting multiple external users onto powerbi.com, you have to manage access to reports, workspaces, apps and tenant settings to ensure users can't accidentally break something, can't see each other's email address or can't access data accidentally see data they should not be able to.","title":"Can't I just use Power BI to share reports?"},{"location":"faq/#how-does-binokula-make-power-bi-report-sharing-better","text":"Binokula focuses on the common issues people encounter with Power BI report sharing while still retaining all the goodness that made them choose Power BI in the first place.
