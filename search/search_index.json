The aim is to make it as simple and easy as possible for report builders, administrators and end users.</p> <p>Easy for Report Builders - Microsoft Power BI has become one of the dominant players in the self-service data preparation and visualization market. Instead of creating our own bespoke visualization framework, we want to enable anybody who is familiar with Power BI to hosts reports on the Binokula platform. Power BI also takes care of data-preparation, scheduling, storage and presentation - which means you don't have to add additional tools or infrastructure to your environment.</p> <p>You don't have to worry about mixing Binokula content with any existing Power BI content you might have - we create a separate Power BI tenant for you that is dedicated only to Binokula. This also ensures nobody else can access your data.</p> <p>Any change on a Power BI report is immediately reflected when users access the report in Binokula.</p> <p>Binokula even integrates with the mobile layout configuration of Power BI, which means you can create mobile views of your reports without much effort at all.</p> <p>Easy for Administrators - After publishing a Power BI Report, you would want your users to access their reports. This is easily managed within the Binokula application and is as simple as:</p> <ol> <li>Creating a report group</li> <li>Assigning the report to the report group</li> <li>Assigning users to the report groups</li> <li>Sending an invitation to users</li> </ol> <p>This process makes it easy to provide access to only the reports that you wish users to see, allowing you to create different views for different audiences. As an administrator, you will also have real-time access to the report usage metrics on Binokula. Users can also be auto-disabled if they haven't logged in after a certain number of days. You can even direct a user back to your own website if they log out of Binokula.</p> <p>Easy for End Users - As an end user you will be able to access Binokula with your email and password OR have single-sign-on experience from an existing portal.
