What is Binokula? Binokula is a report sharing website which provides an organization with the power to securely share reports with their business affiliates. Affiliates could be customers, suppliers, subsidiaries, dealers, franchisees, brokers, agents, frontline workers, business associates or partners. Binokula attempts to address most of the common problems associated with secure report sharing. With Binokula you will be able to: Easily expose secure, interactive reports created with Microsoft Power BI. Seamlessly integrate Binokula with your existing portal. Restrict users' access to only their reports and data. Scale up to thousands of users, if required. Track when users access their reports. Quickly publish new reports or change existing reports, all without needing a software developer. Automate the entire process, while knowing that Binokula constantly monitors the platform for you. What does Binokula look like? See for yourself by selecting one of the demo users on the Binokula demo site Reports can also be configured for mobile viewing. How does Binokula work? Binokula provides a set of services based around Microsoft Power BI. It allows you to publish and share reports built in Power BI through a centralized website. Each user will manage their own login on Binokula or you give them access through the Single-Sign-On API. Binokula ensures users can only see reports assigned to them and automatically enforces row-level security (RLS) to each report. Binokula licensing is by active users instead of named. Users don't need to be integrated with Azure Active Directory, don't require a Microsoft Account and don't need a Power BI Pro license. Step 1: Use Power BI to: Connect, prepare, model and schedule data loads Apply row-level data security Build reports and mobile views you wish to share Step 2: You use Binokula to Provide a portal for users to access their reports Provide mobile views of reports Secure access to specific reports Provide single-sign-on for users from your existing website to their reports Know that Power BI row-level security is enforced Add, delete or disable users View real-time and historical report usage Most of Binokula's existing customers use Power BI for their internal business analytics but came to Binokula to for external report sharing. A pure Power BI report sharing option would have placed unwanted constraints on users like having named Power BI Pro Licenses or Azure Active Directory accounts or having a Microsoft account. Binokula simplifies the report sharing landscape while leveraging the report delivery capabilities of Power BI. How is Binokula different to other report sharing tools? Binokula has been created specifically with secure report sharing in mind. The aim is to make it as simple and easy as possible for report builders, administrators and end users. Easy for Report Builders - Microsoft Power BI has become one of the dominant players in the self-service data preparation and visualization market. Instead of creating our own bespoke visualization framework, we want to enable anybody who is familiar with Power BI to hosts reports on the Binokula platform. Power BI also takes care of data-preparation, scheduling, storage and presentation - which means you don't have to add additional tools or infrastructure to your environment. You don't have to worry about mixing Binokula content with any existing Power BI content you might have - we create a separate Power BI tenant for you that is dedicated only to Binokula. This also ensures nobody else can access your data. Any change on a Power BI report is immediately reflected when users access the report in Binokula. Binokula even integrates with the mobile layout configuration of Power BI, which means you can create mobile views of your reports without much effort at all. Easy for Administrators - After publishing a Power BI Report, you would want your users to access their reports. This is easily managed within the Binokula application and is as simple as: Creating a report group Assigning the report to the report group Assigning users to the report groups Sending an invitation to users This process makes it easy to provide access to only the reports that you wish users to see, allowing you to create different views for different audiences. As an administrator, you will also have real-time access to the report usage metrics on Binokula. Users can also be auto-disabled if they haven't logged in after a certain number of days. You can even direct a user back to your own website if they log out of Binokula. Easy for End Users - As an end user you will be able to access Binokula with your email and password OR have single-sign-on experience from an existing portal. You also don't need to associate your email with any other authentication service. graph TB A0[User opens browser] A0-->A1[User logs on to Binokula] A0-->A2[User logs on to your website] A2-->|Your website uses Binokula SSO|A1 end Once you access Binokula you will either be: Taken directly to your report (if you have only one report assigned) OR Taken to your default report (if you saved a default report) OR Taken to the list of reports you can have access to. Reports are read-only but fully interactive and you will only see the data you are meant to. There are no additional buttons, menus or confusing user interfaces. Who uses Binokula? Binokula is used by organizations that: Need to securely share reports with users who are affiliated with their organization. Need to provide an interactive experience for users instead of emailing static PDF documents. Need to empower business users to control report sharing. Need to avoid a large and complex IT projects. Need to avoid licensing per named user. Need to be up and running as soon as possible.

This includes: Getting access to a Binokula Tenant Building and publishing a report in Power BI Desktop Providing access to reports in Binokula Automating data refreshes Getting a Binokula Tenant A Binokula Tenant is your dedicated area for publishing, hosting and managing access to your report content. Only organizations that wish to share and control access to reports need a Tenant. If you are expecting to just access reports in Binokula, you will need to be added as a User on a Tenant. If your organization wishes to get a trial Tenant, please contact sales@binokula.com . If you are expecting to already have access to reports in Binokula, you can enter your email address at https://binokula.app or contact the organization whose report content you wish to access. Building and Publishing Reports Building a Report without RLS Binokula uses Microsoft Power BI as its report building tool. It is possible for a report to be published to Binokula without any RLS. For a report to be correctly published in Binokula without RLS, the report has to adhere to the following: The User Security configuration must be set to ignored. This can be done through Report Management under Binokula Admin page. Building a Report with RLS RLS - Row-Level Security ensures that users see only the data they are authorized to see. Building a report with RLS requires that the report adhere to the following: Must have a security role called \"User_Security\" in the Power BI Model. Show \"User_Security\" example Must have a DAX filter on the Entity to User Mapping List which uses the USERNAME() function. The table the DAX filter is on must contain the list of the users emails. Show USERNAME() example Cross filter direction should be set to Both for the relationship with Entity to User Mapping List Apply security filter in both directions should be ticked for the relationship with Entity to User Mapping List Show Cross Filter and Apply Security Fiter Both example Testing Power BI RLS Once you have configured the RLS as shown above, you can test the security by impersonating a user. To do this: Click \"View as Roles\" in Power BI Desktop; Tick \"Other User\" and enter the test user's email address; and Tick \"User_Security\" and click OK. Show \"View as Roles\" screen You should now only see data that the test user should see. Power BI Workspaces Binokula supports multiple Power BI workspaces. This means any Power BI report can be published into any workspaces under your tenants publisher account. To ensure your report appears on Binokula, your tenants admin account must be a member of the workspace. To include your tenants admin to your selected workspace: Log into powerbi.com as your assigned publisher account. Navigate to your chosen workspace. At the top click \"Access\". Workspace access button In the Email search bar start typing admin. Your tenants admin account will have the same domain as your publisher account. In the drop down menu select \"Member\". Click Add. Add admin to workspace Reports within that workspace will now be available in Binokula after a Report Refresh in the Binokula Admin portal. Publishing Power BI Reports Once you have built and tested your Power BI report, the next step is to publish the report to your dedicated Tenant. This is done with the unique publisher account, details you would have received as part of requesting your Binokula Tenant. You can sign-in with the publisher account by clicking on \"Sign in\" in Power BI Desktop. If you are already signed in with a different account, click on the account name and select \"Switch account\". Once you are signed in, you can publish the report by: Saving any changes; Clicking on the \"Publish\" button on the Home menu; and Choosing \"Binokula\" as the destination before clicking \"Select\" Note: Save the report with a friendly name that you would want your users to see. Try to avoid names with abbreviations and version numbers like \"test_fin_HL_V0.13\". Editing an existing report can be done by re-publishing the same report from Power BI Desktop. Select Yes when prompted to overwrite the dataset. Another way to edit an existing report is by making changes on powerbi.com with your publisher account. Re-publishing from Power BI Desktop will override these changes. Reseting your Publisher Account Password To reset your tenants Publisher Account password: Navigate to the Administrator page Go to Portal settings Click the \"Reset Publisher Account Password\" link and confirm Copy and use the strong temporary password provided to sign into your tenants Publisher Account via Power BI Note: You will be prompt to change your password upon your initial sign in using the provided temporary password. Report for Mobile Viewing Power BI Mobile is supported by Binokula. All you need to do is create the mobile view of a report in the Power BI Desktop file and publish it to your Tenant. Please see Microsoft's Power BI Phone Report documentation for more information on configuring phone layout on Power BI Desktop. Show Phone Layout option in Power BI Desktop Managing Tenant details Assigning your organization name to your tenant Your organization name will be used in automated emails sent out to users and other front facing features that labels your tenant. Navigate to the Admin Page and click \"Portal Settings\" Under the field \"Organization Name\" enter the name of your organization. Click save. Managing access to reports in Binokula Any new reports published are by default not accessible to any users. Access to reports is controlled through Report Groups. To give yourself access to view a report, you will need to be an administrator and complete the following in Binokula: Import the report definition into Binokula by clicking on the Refresh button in the reports administration page; Create a new Report Group in the report group administration page; Add the new report to the Report Group; Add yourself as a user in the report group; and Select the report in the Reports user page. Assigning more users and reports The process is exactly the same as the previous steps, all you have to do is add more users. If it will be too time-consuming to add users by one-by-one, you can create a script to call the Binokula REST API to add users in bulk. Please see the Developer Guide for details on the REST API. If you need to expose more than one report to a specific audience, multiple reports can also be added to a Report Group through the Report Group administration page. Note: Currently communications to end users are managed by Tenant administrators. However, you can send a Forgot Password link to users directly in the User Management administration page. Typical onboarding communication contains a link to the Binokula.app page with instructions to enter their email address and then click the Reset password link. Automating and scheduling the refresh of report data Refreshing data for Binokula reports is the same as in any other Power BI report*. Any on-premise data used in the report needs to be supported by the Power BI On-Premise Data Gateway. The on-premise data gateway needs to be installed and configured with the credentials of your unique publisher account. Cloud data sources also need to be supported by the Power BI service. Additional information on Power BI's data refresh capabilities can be found here: Data refresh in Power BI Refresh Data Sources from Power BI Desktop *The Power BI Data Model still needs to have the \"User_Security\" role created in Power BI Desktop. Once you have an on-premise data gateway configured, you can access powerbi.com with your assigned publisher account and configure the schedule refresh as per the Power BI Documentation . Managing Users User Management is done through the user management link in the admin portal. This interface will allow you to: Add new users Delete users Enable/disable users Enable/disable admins Enable/disable report sharing Reset passwords Test Users User management functions Note: Users are automatically added when programmatically signed in with the single-sign-on API . Bulk adding, deleting, enabling or disabling more than one user at a time can be achieved programmatically by calling the User Management API . Testing Users It is possible to test users under your tenant. Admins can imitate users in their tenant through user management . Simply click the \"Test User\" link under the associated user and follow the instructions on the prompt that displays. Testing Users A message will prompt you to copy a link into a private or incognito browser to ensure you don't lose your current Binokula session. Report Export Permissions The Export feature will be activated for a customer upon request. Once activated, the customer\u2019s Binokula Admin can enable the Export function for specific users as required. Users can then export a report by: displaying the Reports screen, for a report selecting whether to export to a PDF or PowerPoint file, then clicking \u2018Export Report\u2019. Once \u2018Export Report\u2019 is clicked, a new tab is opened and the report is exported in the background. Once the export processing is complete, a download link is displayed and the report can be downloaded using the normal browser download function. Report Sharing Permissions Admins have the ability to grant users the ability to share their reports via a link. This shared link is secured and only people who have the generated link can view the report. The shared report will be have the same view as the user who shared the link. When the report sharing is disabled for a user, all existing shared links for each report will become invalid. Managing Reports Report Management is done through the report management link in the admin portal. This interface will allow you to: Delete a Report. Note: If the report still exists within the Power BI Workspace the report will reappear within the next refresh. Enforce/Ignore User Security Roles on the selected report Report Reference Ask admin to enable report reference feature. Go to https://binokula.app/Admin/Reports Consume Report Reference: * External Access Using Report Reference Get Embed Token Using Report Reference User Groups User Group Management is done through the user group link in the admin portal. The User Group management page allows admins to: Create a new User Group Delete a new User Group Edit User Group Details Assign existing users to the group Assign the User Group to one or multiple report groups User group functions User Group Structure Users within a User Group can be assigned to a Report Group. This function allows easier assignment and reassignment of multiple users to reports. RLS Aliasing Admins have the option of enabling username aliasing to their users. Users can share the same alias. By enabling RLS Aliasing the RLS then uses the users alias as the filter on the report. Your Reports filtering must be mapped to the aliasing of your choice. The RLS Aliasing and enablement can be found on the User Management page. Editing users RLS Alias Navigate to the Admin page then select \"User Management\" Find the user you want to edit their alias for Click \"Edit RLS Alias\" on the users row.

Current end-points focus on user management and access to reports. All API calls are secured with SSL, tenant names and API Keys (client_secret). If you need access to your client_secret, please contact support@binokula.app . Client Secret Your Client is used to access Binokula's API endpoints. Your tenants Client Secret can be accessed by an Admin account. To find your tenants Client Secret: Sign into Binokula with an Admin account Navigate to the Administrator page Go to Portal settings Find the label Client Secret and click \"Show Client Secret\" From there you can copy the Client Secret and start using Binokula APIs! Managing Client Secrets It is possible to have multiple client secrets. If you feel that a current client secret has been comprimised then you can delete it and generate new ones. To manage your client secrets: Navigate to the Administrator page Go to Portal Settings Click \"Client Secret Options\" From there you can delete client secrets and generate new ones by clicking the \"Generate New Client Secret\" button Note: Each tenant must have atleast 1 client secret Single-Sign On Overview Single-Sign On (SSO) enables external applications to give users access to Binokula without the need for them to enter their Binokula password. Access to Binokula is gained with the combination of a user's email address and a securely generated access token. The access token is valid for one hour and can be refreshed using the API. Binokula will check if the users email is registered as a system user and if the access token is valid before granting access to the application. If authentication fails, a redirect to the Binokula login page will be executed. Only one user token can be active at any given time. sequenceDiagram User->>Organization App: User Requests access to Binokula Organization App->>Binokula API: App requests access_token from API Binokula API->>Organization App: App constructs SSO URL with token Organization App->>Binokula App: App opens Binokula App URL Binokula App->>Binokula App: If valid, Binokula reports are shown Binokula App->>Binokula App: If not valid, Binokula Login page is shown Endpoints Issue/Renew User Access Token URL: https://api.binokula.app/api/Token HTTP Verb: GET Headers: client_secret Parameters: email tenant code This is a function key provided to the customer to access this endpoint existingusersonly (optional) Boolean Default set to \"false\".

Binokula is an online service that enables organisations to share their interactive reports with users internal or external to their organisation. A user only needs an internet connection and a browser to be able to access reports. The user does not need a software licence, or to install any additional software. Also, the user does not need to be registered in the organisation\u2019s Azure directory. An organisation uses Binokula\u2019s security features to manage a user\u2019s access to Binokula and their reports. The Binokula service is a web application hosted in the Microsoft Azure cloud so any user on the world-wide internet can be provided access to an organisation\u2019s reports. Why should I use Binokula for report sharing? Providing users outside your organisation with secure access to interactive reports can be challenging. Depending on the approach, the following issues can be experienced: Additional licenses to purchase for users; incurring the cost of the licenses and the on-going administration of those licenses. Additional software for users to install. This can be complex to support as external users can often have different desktop configurations and security requirements. IT department overhead should users need to be invited as guest users into the organisations Azure directory. Developing your own solution means that you have all the issues, costs, and on-going maintenance associated with a software application\u2019s development and deployment. Binokula addresses these issues head on by wrapping an easy-to-use service around Microsoft\u2019s Power BI, making secure report sharing as easy as possible. Can\u2019t I just use Power BI to share reports? It depends, Power BI is a terrific product but may not be an ideal fit if you want to share reports externally. Most Binokula customers use Power BI for their internal business analytics, but when it came to sharing reports externally, they typically\u202fencountered the following issues: Licensing - If sharing reports directly from powerbi.com, each external user must be licensed with a Power BI Pro license and their account needs to be either an Azure Active Directory (AD) account or a Microsoft Account. Power BI Premium avoids the need to purchase Pro licenses, but users are still required to have an Azure Active Directory account or Microsoft account. Portal Integration \u202f- If you already provide a web portal for your users and you wish to integrate powerbi.com reports, you are left with 2 choices: Provide a link to a report URL and expect users to authenticate with their Azure AD or Microsoft account. Commission your web portal developers to use Power BI Embedded and present reports from your portal. Risk \u202f- If you are inviting external users into your powerbi.com, you will need to manage access to reports, workspaces, apps, and settings. This is to ensure users can\u2019t accidentally break something, can\u2019t see each other\u2019s email addresses, and can\u2019t access data that they are not authorised to access. How do I get my reports into Binokula? Binokula customers build their interactive reports in Microsoft Power BI Desktop and publish them into a dedicated \u2018Binokula\u2019 workspace in their Power BI Service (powerbi.com) tenant. Once a report is published into this \u2018Binokula\u2019 workspace, it is automatically detected by Binokula and the Binokula administrator can then grant users permission to access the report. Report publishing is explained in\u202fBuilding and Publishing Reports section in the Admin Guide. Do I need to know how to use Power BI? Report Viewers\u202f\u2013 If you are viewing Power BI reports in Binokula, you do not need to know Power BI at all. All you need to do is login to your account and view the reports assigned to you. Report Builders\u202f- If you are a Binokula administrator then you will need to learn the basics of Power BI. There are many free resources on the internet to get started. Binokula will support any Power BI report supported by Power BI Embedded. If you are using some specialist features like row-level-security (RLS) then you will need to implement these in a specific manner. This is explained in\u202fBuilding and Publishing Reports section in the Admin Guide. How do I login to Binokula? Your organisation\u2019s Binokula account is managed by your organisation\u2019s Binokula administrator. The administrator will send you an email to invite you to access Binokula. If you have been advised that you already have access to view reports in Binokula, then please see the\u202f Getting Started section in the User Guide.","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"faq/#faq","text":"","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"faq/#what-is-binokula","text":"Binokula is an online service that enables organisations to share their interactive reports with users internal or external to their organisation.
